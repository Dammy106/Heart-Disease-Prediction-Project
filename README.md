# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Project
Using two Machine Learning Models to predict heart disease.
# Overview
This project focuses on predicting heart disease using the Heart Disease UCI dataset from Kaggle. I used two machine learning models: Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression to classify whether a person has heart disease based on various health indicators.
#Steps Followed
##Data Preparation:

Performed initial data analysis to understand the features.
Handled categorical variables using one-hot encoding (e.g., for 'cp' and 'thal').
Standardized the numerical features to scale the data.
